# 5G Network Slicing with Machine Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains code and documentation for implementing 5G network slicing using machine learning techniques. The primary focus is on evaluating the performance of network slicing through cross-validation, analyzing results using confusion matrices, and employing Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree classifiers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/5g-network-slicing.git
    cd 5g-network-slicing
    ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. Ensure your dataset is formatted appropriately. Refer to the `data` folder for an example dataset.

2. Run the data preprocessing script:

### Cross-Validation

1. Explore different machine learning models using cross-validation:

2. Review the generated results in the `results` folder.

### Confusion Matrix

1. Evaluate the performance of the models using confusion matrices:

2. Find the confusion matrices in the `results` folder.

### Classifier Implementation

1. Train and evaluate Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree classifiers:


2. Examine the model performance metrics and visualizations in the `results` folder.
